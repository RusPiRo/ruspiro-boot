//! # RusPiRo Boot Strapping for Raspberry Pi
//!
//! This crates provides the startup routines that are needed to be run from a baremetal kernel on
//! the RaspberryPi before execution could be handed over to Rust code.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Put the following code into your main rustfile of the binary that should be build for the
//! Raspberry Pi:
//! ```ignore
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate ruspiro_boot;
//!
//! come_alive_with!(alive);
//! run_with!(running);
//!
//! fn alive(core: u32) {
//!     // do one-time initialization here
//! }
//!
//! fn running(core: u32) -> ! {
//!     // do any processing here and ensure you never return from this function
//!     loop {}
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The bootstrapper requires specific symbols to be known to the linker to be able to build the
//! final binary. To use the linker script that is provided as part of this crate in
//! your own rust binary crate you could either copy them manually from the git repository based on
//! your desired target architecture for the build:
//! [aarch32 linker script](https://github.com/RusPiRo/ruspiro-boot/blob/v0.3.1/link32.ld)
//! [aarch64 linker script](https://github.com/RusPiRo/ruspiro-boot/blob/v0.3.1/link64.ld)
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - `with_panic` will ensure that a default panic handler is implemented.
//! - `singlecore` enforces the compilation of the single core boot sequence. Only the main core 0 is then running.
//! - `ruspiro_pi3` is passed to dependent crates to properly build them for the desired Raspberry Pi version
//!
//! To successfully build a bare metal binary using this crate for the boot strapping part it is
//! **highly recomended** to use the linker script provided by this crate. Based on the target
//! architecture to be built it is either [link32.ld](link32.ld) or [link64.ld](link64.ld). To
//! conviniently refer to the linker scripts contained in this crate it's recommended to use a
//! specific build script in your project that copies the required file to your current project
//! folder and could then be referred to with the `RUSTFLAG` parameter `-C link-arg=-T./link<aarch>.ld`.
//! The build script is a simple `build.rs` rust file in your project root with the following
//! contents:
//! ```no_run
//! use std::{env, fs, path::Path};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // copy the linker script from the boot crate to the current directory
//!     // so it will be invoked by the linker
//!     let ld_source = env::var_os("DEP_RUSPIRO_BOOT_LINKERSCRIPT")
//!         .expect("error in ruspiro build, `ruspiro-boot` not a dependency?")
//!         .to_str()
//!         .unwrap()
//!         .replace("\\", "/");;
//!     let src_file = Path::new(&ld_source);
//!     let trg_file = format!(
//!         "{}/{}",
//!         env::current_dir().unwrap().display(),
//!         src_file.file_name().unwrap().to_str().unwrap()
//!     );
//!     println!("Copy linker script from {:?}, to {:?}", src_file, trg_file);
//!     fs::copy(src_file, trg_file).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
