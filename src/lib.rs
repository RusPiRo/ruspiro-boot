//! # RusPiRo Bootstrapping for Raspberry Pi
//!
//! This crates provides the startup routines that are needed to be run from a baremetal kernel on
//! the RaspberryPi before execution could be handed over to Rust code.
//! 
//! The crate is only valid when compiled for the
//! target architecture **aarch64**. However, event though this crate might be compiled for this target architecture it
//! is tailor made for the Raspberry Pi 3. This crate may be used in other contexts at your own risk. To build your own
//! Raspberry Pi bare metal kernel or operating system please use the
//! [RusPiRo Turorials](https://github.com/RusPiRo/ruspiro-tutorials) as a starting point.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Put the following code into your main rustfile of the binary that should be build for the
//! Raspberry Pi:
//! ```ignore
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate ruspiro_boot;
//!
//! come_alive_with!(alive);
//! run_with!(running);
//!
//! fn alive(core: u32) {
//!     // do one-time initialization here
//! }
//!
//! fn running(core: u32) -> ! {
//!     // do any processing here and ensure you never return from this function
//!     loop {}
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! Feature         | Description
//! ----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//! ``multicore``   | Enables the compilation of the multi core boot sequence. Without it only the main core 0 is running.
//!
//! ## Hint:
//! To successfully build a bare metal binary/kernel that depends on this one to perform the boot
//! strapping part it is **highly recomended** to use the linker script [link64.ld](https://github.com/RusPiRo/ruspiro-boot/blob/v||VERSION||/link64.ld) provided by this crate.
//! To conviniently refer to the linker scripts contained in this crate it's recommended to use a
//! specific build script in your project that copies the required file to your current project
//! folder and could then be referred to with the `RUSTFLAG` parameter `-C link-arg=-T./link64.ld`.
//! The build script is a simple `build.rs` rust file in your project root with the following
//! contents:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::{env, fs, path::Path};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // copy the linker script from the boot crate to the current directory
//!     // so it will be invoked by the linker
//!     let ld_source = env::var_os("DEP_RUSPIRO_BOOT_LINKERSCRIPT")
//!         .expect("error in ruspiro build, `ruspiro-boot` not a dependency?")
//!         .to_str()
//!         .unwrap()
//!         .replace("\\", "/");;
//!     let src_file = Path::new(&ld_source);
//!     let trg_file = format!(
//!         "{}/{}",
//!         env::current_dir().unwrap().display(),
//!         src_file.file_name().unwrap().to_str().unwrap()
//!     );
//!     println!("Copy linker script from {:?}, to {:?}", src_file, trg_file);
//!     fs::copy(src_file, trg_file).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
